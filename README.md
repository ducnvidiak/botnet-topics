# Botnet Project

## Introduction

The Botnet Project is an open-source repository designed for security research and testing of network attacks. This project aims to support research and development of measures to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and other botnet-related attacks. It provides tools to simulate botnet behavior in a controlled test environment, helping researchers and security professionals test and improve defensive systems.

### Important Notes

- **Do not use this botnet for real-world attacks.**
- The source code in this repository should only be used in controlled testing and research environments.
- Deploying the botnet on systems or networks without explicit consent is illegal and may result in criminal liability.

## Features

- **Malware analysis:** Provides tools for studying and analyzing the behaviors of botnets.
- **Security testing:** Helps develop and test measures to prevent DDoS attacks and other network-based attacks.
- **Monitoring and analysis:** Integrates traffic monitoring tools and analyzes botnet behavior in a safe environment.

## Warning

- **Do not deploy the botnet on unauthorized networks.**
- Using the botnet in uncontrolled environments may harm systems and data of others. This could violate security laws and cause significant damage.
- Ensure that you only use this tool in authorized test or lab environments.
- You are not allowed to attack or infiltrate systems without the explicit consent of the owner. Any unauthorized actions will result in legal liability.
- This project is for research and educational purposes in a controlled environment only.
